;; Workaround for shift-enter trouble on Windows

;; UPDATE: Because Emacs ESS changes made this MUCH easier, my
;; re-work gets shorter :=)


;; INSTRUCTIONS. Put this file in ~/.emacs, or in ~/emacs.d/init.el,
;; or in the Emacs site-start.d folder.

;; R USER PREVIEW.
;; Here are my special features related to ESS with R.

;; 1. Indentation policy follows Programming R Extensions Manual
;; UPDATE 2013-07-10. No longer needed. This is ESS default as of version 13-05

;; 2. Shift+Enter will send the current line to R, and it will start R
;; if it is not running.  ESS 13-05 chose instead CTL+Enter, which I
;; DO NOT want because it conflicts with CUA mode.

;; 3. R will assume the current working directory is the document directory.

;; 4. R runs in its own "frame"

;; 5. Emacs help pops up in its own frame.


;; JUSTIFICATION.  The intention is to make Emacs work more like a
;; "modern" GUI editor.
;; See my companion lecture
;; "Emacs Has No Learning Curve"
;; http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse

;; some changes. And for no benefit, as SAS mode still not great.
;; I had to cut out a lot of framepop stuff.
